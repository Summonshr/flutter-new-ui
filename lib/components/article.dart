    'An essential question is why existence is boundless. We can say, “that is the way it is,” but that’s not so satisfying to hear—especially for someone who is inquisitive. \n\n\t\t\tWell, the human mind deals in duality in order to perceive the world, and we think if we were born, then the universe must have had a beginning (Parvez, Hanan). But the universe doesn’t have to conform to the human mind. We are often too egocentric to see past our limited capabilities. \n\n\t\t\tIn fact, you and I were never born—not exactly. Each of us were formed out of existing matter and energy (Johnston, Ian). You didn’t poof into existence, and no thing ever has. \n\n\t\t\tMatter and energy transitions, rather than get created or destroyed (Kaunana). People talk about the universe being “born” like it was a magic show or a miracle, but even the universe as we know it was present before the Big Bang. Live Science states that, “Rewind far enough (about 13.8 billion years), and the entire universe shrinks to the size of a single atom, Hawking said. This subatomic ball of everything is known as the singularity (not to be confused with the technological singularity during which artificial intelligence will overtake humans).\n\n\t\t\t Inside this extremely small, massively dense speck of heat and energy, the laws of physics and time as we know them cease to function ” (Specktor, Brandon). In the same article, Stephen Hawking is quoted as saying, “It was always reaching closer to nothing but didn’t become nothing. There was never a Big Bang that produced something from nothing. It just seemed that way from mankind’s point of perspective.”';
